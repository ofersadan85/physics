[![pytest](https://github.com/ofersadan85/physics/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ofersadan85/physics/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

This is a simple physics simulator build with Python.
It uses [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) to run the math using vectors, and [opencv](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/) to display the simulation.

## Warning
This is purely a hobby project of mine, do not use it for anything serious. That being said it is meant to be very easy to use and understand, and I welcome any feedback or contributions.
